  <p class="lead">Gene prediction model can be represented as matrix-Expression-Similarity-Frequency-based, consisting of a new scoring scheme for gene-gene associations based on a given linear differential expression measurement selection in diverse experimental conditions of individual samples mixed to their frequencies of occurrence and their combined with gene-gene similarity measures mixed to their frequencies as results of the matrix-Similarity-based, which yield the final association score. </p>

         <li> <p class="lead">A first step in Gene prediction model is to fix a p-value to the dataset, in order to demonstrate that expression of theses candidates’ genes as expected to change the methods employed in the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. </p></li>
         <li><p class="lead">A second step in Gene prediction model is the computation of semantic similarity of candidates’ genes, assumed using the Wang et al method, and using GOSemSim package, based on the information’s content (IC), and a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The IC-based measures depend on the frequencies of two GO terms involved on the annotation statistics of their closest common ancestor term in a specific corpus of GO annotations, and the best-match average strategy (BMA) method to calculates the average of all maximum similarities on each row and column. Whether, a new scoring scheme for gene-gene associations based on gene-gene similarity measures. </p></li>
         <li><p class="lead">A third step in which we introduce the matrix-Similarity-based, used for every pair of genes of dis/similarity scores as demonstrated here (Formula. 1), which the matrix evaluates whether the means and normally distributed score within each independent pair of genes of samples evaluates an important significance. </p></li>

matrix-Expression-Similarity-Frequency-based. Theses statistic scores are used the candidate’s genes as demonstrated here (Formula. 2), which the genes with the highest scores will be selected and improved first, then to serve as inputs to the next steps. </p></li>
