  <p class="lead">As the number of interacting genes increases, and because the traditional statistical methods are limited to their ability to identify interacting genes in high dimensions data. We developed a novel model called mixed-gene tissues interaction (MGTI) for identifying these regulators using high-throughput omics data. </p>

  <h4>Figure1: Genetic interactions of omics data generally refer to a combination pairs of genes into different tissues of fixed clusters, whose contribution to a phenotype between specific variants in complex traits and tissues remaining a major challenge, emerging statistical methods explained by their independent effects,  for mapping complex genotype-phenotype information  </h4>
